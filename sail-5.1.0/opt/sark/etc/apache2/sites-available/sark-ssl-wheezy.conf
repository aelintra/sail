	#   Server Certificate Chain:
	#   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
	#   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
	#   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
	#   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
	#   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
	#   certificate for convinience.
	#SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server-ca.crt

	#   Certificate Authority (CA):
	#   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
	#   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
	#   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
	#   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks

	#   Access Control:
	#   With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based
	#   on arbitrary complex boolean expressions containing server
	#   variable checks and other lookup directives.  The syntax is a
	#   mixture between C and Perl.  See the mod_ssl documentation
	#   for more details.

	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly.
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
	# MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
	BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
