#  Firewall Rules.   
#  SAIL  PIKA and Debian releases use the Shorewall Firewall.  
#  You can learn about Shorewall at  
#  	www.shorewall.net
#
#  SAIL exposes only the Shorewall rules include files in the SAIL browser app.
#  If you wish to do more with Shorewall then you should access the  
#  control files directly by opening an SSH port and accessing 
#  them as root.
#
#  The rules below can be set to suit your installation.
